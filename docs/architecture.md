# RAG System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system is designed to enhance large language model outputs with relevant information from a knowledge base.

## System Components

The RAG system consists of the following main components:

### 1. Document Processing

The document processing component is responsible for:
- Loading documents from various sources and formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, HTML)
- Preprocessing text content (cleaning, normalization)
- Chunking documents into appropriate segments for embedding and retrieval

Key modules:
- `DocumentLoader`: Handles loading documents from various file formats
- Text preprocessing utilities
- Chunking strategies (fixed size, semantic, sliding window)

### 2. Embedding Generation

The embedding generation component:
- Transforms text chunks into vector embeddings using embedding models
- Manages the embedding process with efficient batching and error handling
- Provides interfaces for different embedding models

Key modules:
- `EmbeddingGenerator`: Core class for generating embeddings
- Model adapters for different embedding providers (Sentence Transformers, OpenAI, etc.)

### 3. Vector Database

The vector database component:
- Stores and indexes vector embeddings for efficient retrieval
- Provides similarity search functionality
- Manages metadata associated with embeddings

Key modules:
- Vector database adapter (currently supporting ChromaDB)
- Index management utilities

### 4. Retrieval

The retrieval component:
- Processes user queries
- Performs similarity searches to find relevant documents
- Applies reranking and filtering to improve retrieval quality

Key modules:
- `Retriever`: Core retrieval logic
- Reranking mechanisms
- Filtering utilities

### 5. Generation

The generation component:
- Combines retrieved context with user queries
- Formats prompts for large language models
- Handles interaction with LLM APIs

Key modules:
- `RAGModel`: Integrates retrieval and generation
- Prompt engineering utilities
- LLM client adapters

### 6. API Service

The API service component:
- Provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the RAG system
- Handles authentication and request validation
- Manages asynchronous processing

Key modules:
- FastAPI application
- API models and schemas
- Middleware for authentication, logging, etc.

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion Flow**:
   - Documents are loaded from the file system or other sources
   - Text is extracted, cleaned, and chunked
   - Chunks are embedded and stored in the vector database along with metadata

2. **Query Processing Flow**:
   - User submits a query via the API
   - Query is processed and embedded
   - Relevant documents are retrieved from the vector database
   - Retrieved documents and query are sent to the LLM
   - LLM generates a response based on the provided context
   - Response is returned to the user

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Monolithic**: All components run in a single process
2. **Microservices**: Components are deployed as separate services
3. **Serverless**: Components run as serverless functions

Current implementation uses a monolithic approach for simplicity, but the modular design allows for other deployment strategies.

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible:

1. **New Document Types**: Add new loaders to support additional document formats
2. **Alternative Embedding Models**: Implement adapters for different embedding providers
3. **Vector Database Backends**: Add support for alternative vector databases
4. **Custom Retrievers**: Implement specialized retrieval strategies
5. **LLM Providers**: Add support for different LLM APIs
